        <h2>An Introduction to a Small World of Coding</h2>
        <p>
            College: the first step into adulthood while also
            finding yourself in serious amounts of student loans
            after graduation. My story begins in the fall of 2022
            as a first-year college student with a high school diploma
            and an associate's degree in liberal arts. I chose 
            computer science as my major, even though I had little 
            to no experience in programming. I do remember taking 
            a technology class in sixth grade...but that's about it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is CodeRed?</h2>
        <p>
            I walked into my first semester of college thinking,
            "What is going to happen this year?" Due to where I
            stood on the programming stack, I decided to learn HTML.
            Along that short journey, I met Eric and John. A duo like
            no other: Batman and Robin.
            <ul>
                <li>Eric was a Teacher's Assistant (TA). He thought
                    being young, gay, and mean constituted a personality.
                    Although, he knew a lot more than I did about
                    programming. I don't think I would've made it
                    through my first semester without his help.
                </li>
                <li>
                    John was older, maybe mid-to-late 30s. I could tell 
                    he liked to be in control. But not in a dictatorial way—more
                    like a fatherly way. He tried to help as much
                    as he could while joking every five seconds.
                </li>
            </ul>
            John told me about <i>CodeRed</i>, a twenty-four-hour hackathon hosted by the
            University of Houston. "twenty-four-hours...wow!" I've pulled an all-nighter
            before but I doubt it was close to twenty-four-hours. On top of that, how do
            you expect me to finish a project within twenty-four-hours? Especially one that
            requires some type of programming. I reminded him that I didn't have
            enough experience for this type of competition and that they should look
            for more qualified people. John reassured me that this was Houston's
            first hackathon and no experience was needed. The event was around the
            corner so I wasn't given much time to think about my decision. With the
            limited time available, I had to lock in and dedicate much of my
            time to prepare for a twenty-four-hour competition.<sup><a href="#one">[1]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Ultimate College Road Trip</h2>
        <p>
            Fast forward to October 30, 2022. It's six AM. I left my house at seven AM and
            got to campus at around seven-thirty AM. My friend Cash was there, along with John,
            Eric, and a girl named Alyssa. Alyssa was a free-spirited kind of gal,
            always open to new opportunities. Check-in was at ten AM, and John wanted
            to be on the road by eight AM so we had time to stop if needed. We were waiting
            for one person, Anthony. John gave us until eight-thirty if we were running late,
            a minute more and we were gone. Anthony arrived at eight-thirty on the dot. He
            thought it was funny, but Cash and I didn't. It was cold and he had already
            made us late.
        </p>
        <p>
            After loading our luggage in the trunk John left very little space for one person
            to sit. Alyssa and John had to sit in the front since Alyssa was driving and
            John was giving directions. So it was left for me, Cash, Anthony, or Eric. Cash took
            one for the team. Although logically it made more sense to put me in the back
            since I was the smallest, but I wasn't going to say anything.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Our First Stop: Texas' Largest Gas Station</h2>
        <p>
            Since check-in was at ten AM, we had to make our restroom break quick. That meant
            no lingering, wondering, or purchasing. John was serious about the time and did not
            want to waste any more of it. We completed the restroom break and got
            back on the road. Cash did not want to sit in the back because he wanted to be
            a part of the conversation. This was also likely due to his hearing problem in his left
            ear. So I sat in the back instead. Everyone was happy except me, now I wasn't a part
            of the conversation. Thankfully, I brought my headphones! Listening to music sounded
            like a good idea anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then something hit me—or felt more like a stabbing pain in my stomach. I told
            John to find a place to stop fast. The pain increased but didn't span throughout
            my body. It only hurt in one area. It may be that time of the month, but I just
            got off it so it can't be that. Maybe it was because I forgot to eat breakfast
            that morning or drink enough water. John was panicking in the front seat trying
            to make sure I was okay, I reassured him about the pain and the rest stop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alyssa found a Starbucks and immediately parked. I bolted towards the restroom and quickly
            locked the door. I stayed there for about ten minutes. During which I heard a knock on
            the door. "It's Alyssa. I just wanted to see if you were okay. If you want, I can wait with you
            until you feel better?" "Thank you, Alyssa!" I replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's okay everyone! I'm okay, just a stomach cramp!" I told the group. As Alyssa and I
            walked toward the car, Anthony and Cash made way for my seat in the back. Oh, what gentlemen,
            I thought sarcastically.
        </p>
        <p>On the road again.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Computer Science Zoo</h2>
        <p>
            It would be around nine-thirty AM when we arrived at the University of Houston. Walking to the
            auditorium, we looked like hikers crossing a mountain range, finding a good camping spot
            to rest before nightfall.<sup><a href="#four">[4]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            As we made our way to the auditorium, I imagined what the atmosphere looks and felt
            like. Is it like Penelope Garcia in Criminal Minds? Is it like a science convention?
            I pictured monitors everywhere, chip bags on the ground, a cold dark room,
            chargers and extension cables running through every aisle. I tried to think of every
            possible stereotype for a computer science major.
        </p>
        <p>It turns out I was spot on. It's nine-forty-five AM and we made it in time for check-in!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work?</h2>
        <p>
            Our team consisted of myself, Alyssa, and Veronica. Initially, I felt optimistic about
            our potential because Veronica seemed to be the strongest asset to our group, given her
            experience compared to Alyssa and me. However,as the hours went on, it became clear that
            her hesitation to take risks and push herself limited our ability to make real progress.
            Rather than stepping into the challenges and attempting to build something tangible, we
            defaulted to creating a PowerPoint presentation. It was disappointing because I saw the
            potential for us to do so much more, but we let our fear of failure paralyze us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking back, I wasn't proud of what we accomplished—because, truthfully, we didn't accomplish
            much at all. We spent twenty-four-hours essentially spinning our wheels, avoiding the hard work of coding
            or building something concrete. It felt like a huge waste of time, especially since my goal going
            into the hackathon was to learn something meaningful about computer science, whether it was web
            development, game development, software engineering, or even machine learning. Instead, we came
            to the judges empty-handed, armed only with ideas but no real output to show for our efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            What frustrated me most wasn't just the lack of a deliverable, but rather the missed opportunity to grow.
            I was prepared to feel overwhelmed or even frustrated during the process—that's part of the learning.
            But I never got that chance because we didn't push ourselves enough to experience real challenges.
            That feeling of stagnation, combined with the wasted time, left me deeply dissatisfied. It made me
            realize how important it is not just to participate, but to actively engage and push through discomfort
            to achieve something worthwhile.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Red Bull Stampede</h2>
        <p>
            If there's one thing hackathons are universally known for, it's the legendary midnight
            Red Bull giveaways. The moment the host shouted, "WE ARE NOW SERVING RED BULL!" the room
            erupted in chaos. It was like throwing raw meat into a lion's den. Students leaped from
            their seats with an energy that was both ironic and impressive, considering how drained
            everyone had looked just moments before. Screams echoed to secure their prized can of
            caffeine. It was a sight to behold—an electrifying mix of desperation and excitement
            that could only be fueled by the allure of free energy drinks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cash was fully caught up in the frenzy. He bolted toward the front, grinning like a kid
            on Christmas morning. Meanwhile, I stayed planted in my seat, clutching my water bottle
            like it was a shield. The chaos was amusing from a safe distance, but the thought of
            diving headfirst into that caffeine-crazed mob didn't appeal to me. I was content to let
            the madness play out around me, quietly hydrating while others reveled in their Red
            Bull-fueled adrenaline rush.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>A Humbling Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Morning arrived, and the atmosphere in the room was tense—it was crunch time. The
            clock ticked closer to the noon submission deadline, and the weight of unfinished projects
            hung heavily in the air. Some teams were frantically typing away, racing to debug
            last-minute errors or add finishing touches to their creations. Others, overwhelmed
            by the time constraints or simply burned out, had quietly forfeited, leaving their work
            unfinished. It was unfortunate to see participants drop out, but it also gave the remaining
            teams a glimmer of hope—a slightly better shot at placing.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for my team, our final submission was, admittedly, underwhelming: a PowerPoint
            presentation detailing what we would have done if we had the skills and time to execute.
            Our chances of winning were very slim. When the winners were announced, it came as no
            surprise that our names weren't called.<sup><a href="#two">[2]</a></sup> We didn't even come
            close. Still, I took some solace in the fact that we had submitted something.
        </p>
        <p>
            That experience, though humbling, left a lasting impression on me. I felt embarrassed by our
            lack of preparation and frustration at the missed opportunity. Yet, at the same time, I was
            grateful for the lessons it taught me and the fire it lit to ensure I would never let another
            opportunity slip through my fingers. Next time, I vowed, I would come prepared, push my limits,
            and create something I could be proud of.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>A Moment of Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The drive back home felt like the quiet aftermath of a long, exhausting battle—a moment
            to reflect, process, and decompress.<sup><a href="#five">[5]</a></sup> Cash and I sat in the very back of the car, while
            Anthony and Eric took the middle seats. John and Alyssa, still buzzing from the experience,
            were deep in conversation, sharing their thoughts on the hackathon—what they enjoyed, what they
            struggled with, and how it all felt. Eric was completely passed out, his head bobbing with
            every turn in the road, while Anthony fought to stay awake, chiming in here and there to keep
            the conversation alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            I turned to Cash and admitted something weighing on me the entire weekend: I wasn't
            happy with what we had done. I felt disappointed in myself for not taking the project more
            seriously and for letting the fear of failure hold me back. Cash listened quietly before
            offering a simple reassurance: "You'll be okay. What matters is that you've learned from it,
            and I know you won't let this happen again." His words stuck with me. He was right—this wasn't
            the end. It was a lesson, one I wouldn't forget.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the miles rolled by, I thought about everything I'd experienced. The chaos, the challenges,
            the disappointment—but also the camaraderie, the laughter, and the spark of determination it had
            ignited within me. I didn't walk away with a trophy or a finished product, but I walked away with
            motivation to come back stronger next time.<sup><a href="#six">[6]</a></sup>

        <h2>For Those Seeking Real Advice</h2>
        <p>
            If you're considering your first hackathon, here's the real takeaway: it's about
            winning; it's about showing up, learning, and pushing yourself outside your comfort
            zone. Hackathons are a crash course for teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving. Even
            if you have little to no experience, you'll gain invaluable insights and connections
            that can help you grow.
        </p>
        <p><b>Here's what I wish I knew beforehand:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li id="one"><b>Mastering One Language:</b> 
                Focus on one programming language, mastering its fundamentals while building
                meaningful, small projects. Learn for yourself, not just for the event, to
                create a strong foundation.
            </li>
            <li id="two"><b>Start Small, Think Big:</b> 
                Begin with a small project and gradually scale it up, challenging yourself along
                the way. Avoid overcomplicating things; simplicity often leads to the best results.
            </li>
            <li id="three"><b>Leverage Team Strengths:</b> 
                A strong team balances individual expertise and teamwork. Assign roles based on
                strengths, collaborate effectively, and lean from each other. 
            </li>
            <li id="four"><b>Pack Strategically:</b> 
                Bring whatever you need to stay productive and comfortable—gear, snacks, or even
                a blanket and pillow. Set yourself up for success by planning for long hours.
            </li>
            <li id="five"><b>Ask the Right Questions:</b> 
                Don't hesitate to seek advice, but focus on thoughtful, specific questions. This
                approach ensures you gain valuable insights directly from experts.
            </li>
            <li id="six"><b>Focus on the Journey:</b> 
                Regardless of the outcome, embrace the process and find something rewarding in the
                experience. Growth and enjoyment matter most.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Everyone starts as a beginner; what matters is taking the leap and learning along the way.
            Whether you walk away with a trophy or just a story, the experience will always add value.
